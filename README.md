# MUJAIML
The following codes cover only the basic cases.Borderline conditions have not been tested as of it. subcourse.ipynb is covering the part of the 3 cases
of the 3 cases of the course based question based system which will be separated later.The questionnew.ipynb is for the users who are not registered and are giving the test on 
the basis of 5 maximum skills.The inputs wherever based in the code would be expected to come in a json file(or whatever the backend team deems neccessary)
The codes will run only for specific inputs due to limitations of dataset as of now.The course based recommendation system,the top courses system and 
other recommendation systems will be uploaded by day after tomorrow with discussion with the backend team for what inputs should be sent.You are requested to go through the codes
to get a brief idea about where the things will be needed
